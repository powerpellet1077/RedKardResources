hello!

this repository is made for a private project.
redkard.json contains data on minecraft dungeon arcade cards. this data was taken from [questwalker's personal repo](https://questwalker.github.io/minecraft-dungeons-arcade-cards/), so serious credit to him. this repo may go unupdated, but feel free to make a pr if you are using this for a personal project. 

thanks!
